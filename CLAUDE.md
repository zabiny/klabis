# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

# Rules

- NON-NEGOTIABLE: TDD - always implement test for new functionality before implementing it
  - use [frontend testing patterns](./docs/frontend/testing_patterns.md) for frontend testing
- use backend-development skill when designing, implementing and performing code review of features on backend. 
- use style guide from [UI styling guide](docs/frontend/claude_styling_guide.md) when creating new UI components in
  frontend
